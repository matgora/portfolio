This repository summarizes my private projects, I've done during my studies and free time.

## Projects
**[JointBert](https://github.com/matgora/JointBERT)** - My master's thesis project titled "Spoken Polish Language Understanding". It is a fork of a [JointBert](https://github.com/monologg/JointBERT) repository, where I've added two preprocessed datasets, 4 configs with Polish BERTs and implemented early stopping inside of the code.

**[transfermarkt_analysis](https://github.com/matgora/PAD_PROJEKT)** - Analysis of transfermarkt player prices. Project included scraping the transfermarkt.com website, data cleaning, analysis and visualization with Dash. Project was done as part of a master's thesis course.
